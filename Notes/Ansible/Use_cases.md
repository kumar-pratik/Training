# Use Cases of Ansible

1. [**Provisioning**](https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/provisioning) - All the services like websites, apps etc. needs to be deployed somewhere and ansible helps in provisioning the deployment environment like virtual machines, cloud platforms, network, storage etc. 
1. [**Configuration Management**](https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/configuration-management) - Ansible is widely being used as a configuration management tool.Ansible features an state-driven resource model that describes the desired state of computer systems and services, not the paths to get them to this state. No matter what state a system is in, Ansible understands how to transform it to the desired state.
1. [**Application Deployment**](https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/application-deployment) - Ansible is the simplest way to deploy your applications. It gives you the power to deploy multi-tier applications reliably and consistently, all from one common framework. You can configure needed services as well as push application artifacts from one common system.
1. [**Continuous delivery**](https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/continuous-delivery) - Creating a CI/CD pipeline requires buy-in from numerous teams. You can’t do it without a simple automation platform that everyone in your organization can use. 
1. [**Security**](https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/security-automation) - When you define your security policy in Ansible, scanning, and remediation of security policy can be integrated into other automated processes.
1. [**Orchestration**](https://www.ansible.com/use-cases/orchestration) - Configurations alone don’t define your environment. You need to define how multiple configurations interact and ensure the disparate pieces can be managed as a whole. Out of complexity and chaos, Ansible brings order.
